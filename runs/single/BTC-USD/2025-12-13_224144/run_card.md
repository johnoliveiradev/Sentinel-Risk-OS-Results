## Alignment Notes — BTC (Nov–Dec 2025)

### Market Context  
**Period:** November 14 → December 8, 2025

During the analyzed window, Bitcoin operated under a **corrective and highly volatile regime**, following an extended period of elevated price levels earlier in 2025.

The period was characterized by:

- Sustained downside pressure  
- Elevated volatility  
- Loss of key support levels  
- Increased dispersion between short-term recoveries and broader trend weakness  

Rather than a single abrupt shock, the behavior reflects a **prolonged corrective phase**, with structural instability persisting across multiple weeks.

---

### Interpretation of the Core Stress Window

The Sentinel Risk OS identified a **Core Stress** window during this period, with:

- **Score max:** 4.20  
- **Peak date:** November 21, 2025  

Within the Sentinel framework, *Core Stress* represents a phase of **sustained structural stress**, where volatility, directional pressure, and regime persistence reinforce each other over time.

The peak on November 21 marks the point of **maximum structural compression** within the window — not necessarily a single market event, but the moment where cumulative stress factors reached their highest intensity.

---

### Structural Price Behavior

This Core Stress window coincides with:

- Accelerated downside movements  
- Repeated tests and breaks of intermediate support zones  
- Compression of the trading range at lower price levels  
- Absence of a rapid return to a stable regime  

These characteristics are consistent with a market undergoing **systematic deleveraging and risk reassessment**, rather than transient price noise.

---

### Post-Window Regime Transition

Following the end of the Core Stress window, the Sentinel output indicates a **transition toward lower-intensity regimes**, suggesting that while the most acute stress subsided, structural stability was **not immediately restored**.

This transition reflects a shift from acute stress to a **consolidation phase**, rather than a full regime normalization.

---

### Summary

The BTC Core Stress window observed between mid-November and early December 2025 represents a **structurally coherent corrective episode**, marked by persistent instability and elevated stress intensity.

The Sentinel Risk OS captured this episode as a **continuous stress event**, rather than a collection of isolated price moves, reinforcing its role as a **regime-level risk detection system**, not a short-term signal generator.
